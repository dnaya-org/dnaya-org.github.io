Among the techniques to solve them, graph-based (or complex-network-based) ones show interesting properties. Such methods usually have two steps:
Graph formation: a graph representation of the dataset is constructed following some specific rules. Optimization: a objective function (a loss function and a regularizer) is associated with the graph structure. The optimal solution also solves the underlying machine-learning task. Particularly, clustering tasks can be solved using community detection methods &amp;ndash; for example, using modularity optimization.</description></item></channel></rss>
